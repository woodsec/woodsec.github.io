## Quarterly Attack Surface Assessment
A quarterly attack surface assessment (also known as a QASA) is a security assessment that helps organizations identify and mitigate potential attack vectors. It is typically conducted on a quarterly basis to ensure that an organization's attack surface is continuously monitored and updated.

A QASA typically includes the following steps:

-    Asset identification: The first step is to identify all of the assets that are exposed to the internet. This includes websites, web applications, cloud-based resources, and even physical assets that are accessible from the internet.
-    Vulnerability scanning: Once all of the assets have been identified, they are scanned for known vulnerabilities. This can be done using a variety of tools, including vulnerability scanners, penetration testing tools, and open-source intelligence (OSINT) tools.
-    Risk assessment: The results of the vulnerability scanning are then used to assess the risk of each vulnerability. This includes considering the severity of the vulnerability, the likelihood of it being exploited, and the impact that it would have if it were exploited.
-    Mitigation recommendations: Based on the risk assessment, recommendations are made for how to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities. This may include patching vulnerabilities, implementing security controls, or changing the configuration of assets.

Variations of the following services are included:

- [x] [External Infrastructure Assessment](#external-infrastructure-assessment)
- [x] [Web Application Assessment](#web-application-assessment)
- [x] [OSINT Risk Assessment](#osint-risk-assessment)

A QASA can help organizations to improve their security posture by identifying and mitigating potential attack vectors. It can also help organizations to comply with security regulations, such as the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

Woodsec's QASA experts will assess an organization's attack surface for potential vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations on how to mitigate the identified risks.

# Attack Simulation
## OSINT Risk Assessment
Open-source intelligence (OSINT) is the collection and analysis of publicly available information. OSINT can be used by attackers to gather information about an organization's systems, networks, and employees. This information can then be used to launch attacks, such as phishing campaigns or social engineering attacks.

An OSINT risk assessment is a security assessment that focuses on the risks posed by OSINT. The goal of an OSINT risk assessment is to identify and mitigate the risks that arise from the organization's public presence.

An OSINT risk assessment would typically focus on the following areas:

-    Websites: This includes checking for publicly available information on the organization's website, such as employee names, contact information, and internal network diagrams.
-    Social media: This includes checking for publicly available information on the organization's social media accounts, such as employee posts, photos, and videos.

Woodsec's OSINT risk assessment experts will assess the organization's public presence for potential vulnerabilities, and provide recommendations on how to mitigate the identified risks.
## Social Engineering
Social engineering is the art of manipulating people into doing things they would not normally do, often for malicious purposes. In the context of penetration testing, a social engineering service is a service that helps organisations to identify and mitigate their social engineering risks.

This assessment involves Woodsec's team of social engineers simulating real-world social engineering attacks against an organization's employees. This helps to identify the employees who are most vulnerable to social engineering attacks, and to develop training programs to mitigate these risks.

By offering social engineering services, Woodsec helps organizations to protect themselves from one of the most common and effective methods of cyberattack.
## Red Teaming
Red teaming is a security exercise in which an independent team simulates an attack on an organization's systems and networks. The goal of red teaming is to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in an organization's security before they can be exploited by real attackers.

Woodsec offers red teaming services to help organizations assess their security posture and identify areas for improvement. Woodsec's red team is comprised of experienced security professionals who have a deep understanding of the latest attack techniques. Woodsec's red team will simulate a real-world attack on an organization's systems and networks, using the same techniques that real attackers would use. This allows Woodsec to identify vulnerabilities that may not be detected by traditional penetration testing methods.

The benefits of red teaming include:

- Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities that may not be detected by traditional penetration testing methods.
- Providing organizations with a realistic assessment of their security posture.
- Helping organizations to develop and implement effective security controls.
